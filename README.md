## How it's made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Runescape API(https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/items.json?category=1&alpha=c&page=14)

This project was inspired by my love for the 23 year old MMORPG! I have started playing back in 2006 and still continue to play to this day. This website will allow you to interact with in game items available in the general store, a place where a player could buy and sell items in game. This website includes 3 unique event listeners: submit, click, and keydown. It also includes a list items from an api page that is stored in the db.json file (page used linked above). The submit handles the user login that only accepts username: osgamer and password: runelite that prompts a window alert. The click allows the website user to click on an item in the store in order to obtain information about the item. Lastly, the keydown function has a fun easteregg when the "h" key is pressed. I hope you enjoy playing around with my first website!
