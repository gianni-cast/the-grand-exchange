## How it's made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Runescape API(https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/catalogue/items.json?category=1&alpha=c&page=1)

This project was inspired by my love for the 23 year old MMORPG! I have started playing back in 2006 and still continue to play to this day. This website will allow you to search in game items available on the Grand Exchange, a trading system for players to purchase and sell items from one another. It works similar to how real life sites like ETSY and Ebay work.
